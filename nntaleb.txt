1201212315376455682 2019-12-01 12:51:48 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Ms Chamma, Trishank above was my student. Before he asked a question, he did his homework first; he got answers in return.

1201208361284452358 2019-12-01 12:36:05 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You are a fucking coward and a professional bullshitter. When you run into me physically, why did you cower?

1201163790211014661 2019-12-01 09:38:58 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> My point. History is important; the discipline of history as currently practiced is full of BS with loose norms.

1201151803766853632 2019-12-01 08:51:20 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> A third way to see it is the value of the firm does not change when firm buys back its debt, owing to PV & other stuff.
1201147500591222786 2019-12-01 08:34:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Another way to see it, Luke is that the bonds at 20% are giving a probability of default. Someone who does not need further cash has ~0 probability of default over same period. I muted the fellow who seems entitled to ignore finance 101
1201145116695711746 2019-12-01 08:24:46 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Correct. There were no laws against genocide; there were disparate laws against killing/targeting civilians, etc.
1201140917287165953 2019-12-01 08:08:05 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Let us stop. I don't play games with counterfactuals and "ifs". Your reasoning means every bond trading at discount & every stock trading lower should be treated as a profit for the issuer. Stop now.
1201138947272925184 2019-12-01 08:00:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> "Under the following conditions", bonds would not be at 20%. You need to try to think before making statements in finance. Study some finance.
1201136843313602563 2019-12-01 07:51:54 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, you still don't get it. If you don't need additional financing your bonds would NOT be at 20%.
1201136538148638720 2019-12-01 07:50:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Also there are mechanisms to sue Global Finance magazine for giving awards to #RiadPonzi, give naive investors & savers a false feeling of security.  Also we need @petelx60 to help us investigate how @LebAmUniv gave him an award (before his days).
1201134890168836097 2019-12-01 07:44:08 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You don't get it. Where will you get the funds to buy it back fromm? By borrowing at 20%
1201134611415347201 2019-12-01 07:43:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Nuremberg was a mechanism to enforce internationally laws compatible with then-international norms. Nothing retrospective in the spirit.
1201132728810442752 2019-12-01 07:35:33 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The reason the bonds are lower is because their cost of funds are higher. So, no, the overall gains are economically 0.
1201128353220251655 2019-12-01 07:18:09 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Signs both #RiadPonzi & Bankers Assoc. hired 2 PR firms to whitewash their image/smear critics including @dan_azz, @Nasser_Saidi. Not successful in the West (nobody is stupid) but  # circulating videos in Lebanon.  Some shills: @jassemajaka   cc:@Jad_Ghosn #lebanonprotest
1201124854654742529 2019-12-01 07:04:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> What is that?
1201123221405351937 2019-12-01 06:57:46 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> At the "meeting", #RiadPonzi exhibited a lack of financial proficiency.  He said "We issued CDs at 6%, they are now at 20%, so we have profits."  Imagine a CEO saying: we issued bonds/stocks, their value collapsed, we make yuuge profits if we bought them back 50% lower!
1201117609833455621 2019-12-01 06:35:28 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> RETROSPECTIVE BIGOTEERING 1) no law is retrospective 2) you cannot blame people of a violation of a moral rule (or law) if they could not be possibly aware of such a rule, if such rule came AFTER their actions.  This is similar to the retrospective distortion in #TheBlackSwan.
1201116569100836864 2019-12-01 06:31:20 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Scale analysis is not mine, elaborated by many many scientists.

But it is PATRONAGE that needs to  go. Let me repeat, PATRONAGE! This can ONLY happen via decentralization as the larger the cental state, the more patronage.
1186632810091683841 2019-10-22 08:18:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 6- People are angry because: a-they share the debt burden w/no benefits b-the Leb State messes up everything it touches, except security c-unlike Maluf, kleptocrats do not deliver  The need for religious "harmony"  allowed a multi-sect "elite" to milk the system to the bone.
1186630480583634944 2019-10-22 08:08:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5- (Cont some clarity about #Lebanon) Corruption doesn't necessarily kill economic activity (Brazil's Paulo Maluf "steals but delivers"). Except that the way the Petit Segneurons operate is to use their franchise by imposing yuuuge red tape: No electicity, no garbage collection!
1186628969858322432 2019-10-22 08:02:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 4- The patronage system got out of control: government contracts grabbed by cronies, in a scheme orchestrated by people in/out of government, s.a. the Grand Segneura & many less visible Petit Segneurons populating ministries.   Kleptocracy is traceable& illegal, not patronage!
1186626851491459073 2019-10-22 07:54:22 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3- Meanwhile the Gov is that of a federation, which is good (via healthy sectarianism) but government service is simply PATRONAGE, for each sect to get the max from the system. A healthier federation is to do it according to geography, via municipal power.
1186625972235362310 2019-10-22 07:50:52 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 2- Luckily the Ponzi involves only 2 parties, Leb Gov (via Ramses XIII Salameh) & the banks. Hence easy non-inflationary cancellations w/clawbacks from those who made millions are possible. In the meanwhile Gov is taxing back the banks to cover secondary deficit, very smart move.
1186624773436116993 2019-10-22 07:46:07 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> #LEBANON, in Summary  1- Leb government got involved in a Ponzi (facilitated by Ramses XIII, Riad Salameh) that sucks up all funds from the system. People have no incentive to put $ (say inheritance from a childless maternal aunt) in a business; get >10% interest from the bank.

1168133561725140993 2019-09-01 07:08:38 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You are correct. Dependence does not affect the problem since expectation is linear and the expectation of dependent RVs is still the sum of expectations.

1156864518498242560 2019-08-01 04:49:29 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Papoulis. Never start with stats, start with probability.
1156854492551401472 2019-08-01 04:09:38 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> For "perfect resemblance".
1156848172515225603 2019-08-01 03:44:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I meant Covariance of 1 AND correlation of 1. \sigma_1 = \sigma_2, under condition of \rho =1.

1156844360270602240 2019-08-01 03:29:23 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Psychologists think in correlation. They often conflate correlation with covariance (which includes effects). I just read Plomin's book and am poring over his coauthored textbook. A correlation of 1 does NOT mean perfect resemblance. A covariance of 1 does. pic.twitter.com/nE2YUuoTAt
1156840082894139392 2019-08-01 03:12:23 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Let me reexplain: If there is a significant variance for YOUR own IQ, the link IQ-performance break down.

1156669992689164295 2019-07-31 15:56:30 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 1) Heated debates are markers/eliminate unqualified pple from a scholarly conversation. 2) Heritability: their stats are almost right +cherry picking). But they cook up their numbers. A correlation of .5 (the highest) explains only 25% of the variation. Adjusting I get 6% effect!

1156630018572857345 2019-07-31 13:17:40 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 80% correlation is not 80% reliability but 64% .
1156627465277792257 2019-07-31 13:07:31 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> In other words, a test that self-correlates at 80% has a reliability problem.
1156625435708547072 2019-07-31 12:59:27 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You need to match number of tests taken on both sides. Plus there is a second order effect I will try to calculate later.
1156622583149862912 2019-07-31 12:48:07 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You are saying that the built-in measurement error == sampling error?
1156607878339485697 2019-07-31 11:49:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> See 2nd tweet. You have an uncertainty about YOUR OWN IQ: when you correlate to performance, you lower by a factor.
1156603570004877313 2019-07-31 11:32:34 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> In other words if as @stuartjrichie claims IQ tests correlate at .8, you have a quite large uncertainty about your own IQ hence you should propagate to the performance. The overall correlation is not unconditional.
1156602486528065538 2019-07-31 11:28:16 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Yes but the consequence for an individual is diluted by the fact that he/she doesn't know the true IQ result by some variation.
1156594709621612546 2019-07-31 10:57:21 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So psychologist @stuartjrichie writes a book on IQ. In it he reveals that your own IQ tests correlate at .8— every time you take the test. He didn’t realize the need to discount accordingly correlations IQ-performance by devastating amounts.  Psychology is astrology.

The distribution of correlation has the same shape when debounded, under pretty much all transformations [-1,1] -> (\-infty,\infty), since the transformations has to have a probit (concave-convex) shape. I did the same for p-values.

If Y certain (ρ=1), infinite. If ρ=½, tiny.  All IQ psychology is worthless.

1121905809888358401 2019-04-26 17:36:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Nick my friend, you are 24h  early. We can't say that on Μεγάλη Παρασκευή  a day of lamentations.
1121889023872598017 2019-04-26 16:29:21 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Ha!
1121881142381117440 2019-04-26 15:58:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I mean the historical meaning of "Syria"
1121880407551762434 2019-04-26 15:55:07 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I would settle for Smaller Syria. Never Raqqa, almost never Aleppo, etc. And never never the South-East.
1121879982781943810 2019-04-26 15:53:26 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> We are going back to fictional nationalism. "Nations" are modern inventions with contrived narratives, so anachronistic to use Medieval sources. Cities + regions around them  are robust. Cities have kept SAME names for millennia.
1121878746938712065 2019-04-26 15:48:31 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I would trust a lot more the Syriac sources than Arabic ones to figure out what the natives called something, not those using Arabic as lingua Franca, a language not spoken.
1121877877241331712 2019-04-26 15:45:04 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Whenever you have duals or plurals (Mitzraim => the 2 Egypts) or Balkans, means vague area. Bled Eshshem is plural. Like "the Americas".
1121877422868246529 2019-04-26 15:43:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, again, false derivation; it was vague *because from outside and probably Arabic invador's name to their territories, & does not map to what was called "Syria". Further it is so vague that even Damascus was called "Shem" in Lebanese --never heard "Dimash2" except on the radio.
1121875527470592000 2019-04-26 15:35:43 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> False analogy. "North" is a direction, necessarily vague, a designation (mostly) by people who are not in it.
1121874221825765377 2019-04-26 15:30:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> "Sham" also means "North" in Semitic so can't read too much into this.

1121860543986524160 2019-04-26 14:36:11 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> OK, OK, reading it now. But don't tell anybody.
1121856265838301190 2019-04-26 14:19:11 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> An individual is a robust designator (similar to Krike's "rigid designator"). He/she can change groups at a whim. BTW after my profile in the @NewYorker I've refrained from reading a single sentence in it.
1121854306154688517 2019-04-26 14:11:24 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> But Damascus and Aleppo have always meant the same thing. More of a rigid designator. Welcome to localism (cc:@normonics --for file for arguments)
1121852428746395648 2019-04-26 14:03:56 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> One of the points of localism (cc:@normonics) is that the larger the area, the harder to define a "nationality", which is why nationalism is absurd and highly constructed. A city (say Aleppo) DOES NOT have to be part of an exclusive region.
1121851591152295936 2019-04-26 14:00:36 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I would say however that the name "Syria" was historically that of the region of Antioch: "Syria" doesn't map to "Bled l Shem" which doesn't map to "Sirion" (Biblical) which doesn't map to "Aram".
1121843944940351493 2019-04-26 13:30:13 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> People from Latakia are most certainly more Phoenician than anyone in Lebanon.

1121770644830654465 2019-04-26 08:38:57 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You can say it is Western European if you go back owing to the large mixing in the Neolithic. But better use Western Eurasia as Europe is not a continent for genetics purposes.
1121769186265567232 2019-04-26 08:33:10 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Lebanese have <7% Haplogroup of the crusaders but ~19% light eyes. So even without the recessive gene argument, Crusades cannot explain eye colors. It had to be native and regional.
1121767759136919552 2019-04-26 08:27:29 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> My story is: Anatolia-Zagros-Caucasus Triangle => spread to Med in Bronze age.   So all East Meds + Southern Italy much more related than to outsiders. And Lebanese closest to Kurds, Greeks, Georgians & Northern Iranians.

1080997794666737666 2019-01-03 19:22:12 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No your example requires a probability distribution to have a left mean. I assumed Gaussian as stated in my example (2nd tweet). For the Gaussian left mean is 10^p Sqrt[2/\pi]

1080657448736903168 2019-01-02 20:49:48 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, local correlation != stochastic correlation. Much like local vol!= stochastic vol. Look at my graph at bottom. Also it violates ellipcality. And PCAs become problematic for "g".

1077551144774369280 2018-12-25 07:06:27 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> John, refreshing to have a physicist.  The rule of thumb: if a metric explains less than 1- x% of the variance, it is not a metric. In physics the x can be as low as 10^14. In engineering, often <10^5.  In psychology often >75% of the variations come from variance.
1077544001614553089 2018-12-25 06:38:04 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I agree. Bring it back to philosophy. Because it is not science by any yardstick, 99% closer to pseudoscience.
1077395295519027200 2018-12-24 20:47:10 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Metrics in engineering are metrics. Psychology is BS. Not a single psychologist thought of redefining correlation when it is state dependent.

1077232270921084928 2018-12-24 09:59:22 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Claire, read the last part of the thread. A correlation that varies with the level is not a correlation. So it would drop if you remove bad performance, depending on sample size.
1077229054800117760 2018-12-24 09:46:35 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> If in fact you can improve IQ by studying/preparation, then the measure is even weaker. And it looks like 10 points are easily gotten but need to check. Plus the Flynn effect adds to the issue.
1077226202761449472 2018-12-24 09:35:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> NO but someone who is an employee BUT wants to be free has a lower performance than someone free.

1077174011270963200 2018-12-24 06:07:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You mean embarrassing for psycholophasters?
1077065891920207873 2018-12-23 22:58:14 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You don't need IQ for assessment of the left tail (people bordering on special needs). Any metric would be successful there.
1077049992265764865 2018-12-23 21:55:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> What you have here is no interaction, just additivity for these traits.

1077043977847820288 2018-12-23 21:31:09 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Yes, Smoky, there is no dimensionality problem in animal breeding. The dimensionality problem is in multifactor DNA analysis.
1077040415763771395 2018-12-23 21:17:00 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Ah! Then please show how you compute the standard error.
1077039269485707264 2018-12-23 21:12:26 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You barged in into my comment on DNA analysis/curse of dimensionality, not externally observed traits, without knowing what you are talking about.
1077038828463050753 2018-12-23 21:10:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No you won't. To get the answer from DNA you may need a sample > 10^20 except for monogenic. But you can heuristically work as you are doing by categorizing traits. My point is critiquing DNA analysis for "intelligence". This is what Cochran doesn't seem to grasp.
1077034681743364097 2018-12-23 20:54:13 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Not what I was discussion & Cochran barged into. My point is that if I gave you n DNA of populations (n sample size ) and you shd give me the relation between the genes and the traits, from DNA, what is your standard error?
1077028095289372672 2018-12-23 20:28:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Cochran, to repeat the courtesy, someone who doesn't see the difference between animal breeding & dimensionality problems (polygenic/factor extraction) isn't someone to bother discussing anything with, because these can't be learned by "reading a book".
1076973329532313600 2018-12-23 16:50:25 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Nobody is contesting that. But it doesn't make IQ a numerical measure.
1076970359763685377 2018-12-23 16:38:37 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> It helps better in a falling market than long the linear. Think before tweeting.

1076966643752976385 2018-12-23 16:23:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Interesting: what is the "correlation" w/success compared to "lower" IQ categories (controlling for education, socioeconomic, etc.)?  Look at "corporate sector" compared to a run of the mill MBA.  For a measure to be effective, tail correlation needs to be HIGHER than mean ones.
1076959737525293056 2018-12-23 15:56:25 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Geoff, to pay you back in your own currency, I respect your research but you know nothing about the real world. Stop tweeting anything related to the real world.

1076930070898503686 2018-12-23 13:58:31 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I would mostly predict that you don't understand my point nor measure, nor IQ. For a measure to be a measure it needs to be unique.
1076907280183017472 2018-12-23 12:27:58 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, wisdom is OBSERVABLE. But not from a verbal test. From real life outcomes.
1076900874008625152 2018-12-23 12:02:30 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Most certainly. In left extremes.  The rest, like almost all psychology is nice bullshit.
1076894606212718594 2018-12-23 11:37:36 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Actually more data comes with more noise when you increases variables rather than data per variable.

1076890173328236544 2018-12-23 11:19:59 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I don't like it when someone says insultingly "you know nothing about" something without even considering whether I have done my homework.

1076237839384436737 2018-12-21 16:07:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> "IQ" is an arbitrary metric (say like length of the index finger), overoptimized, predictive of school grades, success as bureaucrat but not in the wild/entrepreneurship.

1076235832393117697 2018-12-21 15:59:52 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Yes. That is a tail event in one dimension. Like running a 100 meters dash in a competition. But origin can't predict 1) how one fares on something that has 000s of dimensions, 2) how indiv A would cross the street as compared to indiv B.  Life has toooo much sampling error.

1072940477962424325 2018-12-12 13:45:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The saying that it takes much more energy to displace than install falsehood is itself a falsehood  1) Sticky "falsehoods" are beneficial or useful for survival (placebo, superstition) 2) Falsehood can only persist if #Lindy 3) Nonhelpful falsehoods tend to collapse very quicky

1071557185707102209 2018-12-08 18:08:36 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Syriac came to Lebanon with the Persians in the 6th C. who brought Greek-hating Nestorians and Zoroastrians. They used Eastern Aramaic. It was for prayers and liturgy, not conversation.
1071556769762209792 2018-12-08 18:06:57 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No
1071556529575354368 2018-12-08 18:05:59 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Big.
1071556211445776384 2018-12-08 18:04:44 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The EVIDENCE we didn't speak Syriac in Leb is that in fact NOBODY spoke Syriac; it was a language of learning. George Kiraz said that the language stayed the same for 1000 years, meaning it was just for writing.  Even Persians wrote in "Aramaic".
1071554457249435648 2018-12-08 17:57:45 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I can show evidence that we spoke Western Aramaic but our liturgy HENCE formal writing was in Eastern one.
1071553087582670849 2018-12-08 17:52:19 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> It is wrong to say that we became part of Arabia in 700. The Turks were neo-Byzantines, so we spent 500 y (~1400-1900) and -300-700 living in Greco-Anatolia, plus some Fatimids, plus Kura-Ataraxes before.
1071544163349467138 2018-12-08 17:16:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Agree. My point all along. But they use Syriac/Aramaic as a broad language that includes offshoots from Canaanite. Aramaic has sooooo many variations.

1070998450152583179 2018-12-07 05:08:23 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> We are not discussing original or well written books. We are discussing books ACADEMICS or other philistines call original or well written.  Gabish?

Editors don't understand books, Academics don't get scholarship. Why?  @rorysutherland : employees' objective is minimizing blame in case of failure.
1070987875213340673 2018-12-07 04:26:22 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 2- How to make a survey work by via negativa.  To assess if a book will survive, find an academic/someone who plays the system. If they say "well organized", "well written", or "original", odds are the book flops.  If they say "messy", "whimsical", the book will outlive him/her.
1070982609331781633 2018-12-07 04:05:26 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 1- Ignore surveys.   Pple think they prefer restaurants 1) quiet so they can tawk, 2) roomy, 3) no line.  Yet they flock to 1) loud, 2) cramped restaurants 3) w/50 min wait.  Never ask pple what they want, watch what they do. Revelation of preferences.  #SkinInTheGame

1069656961854132224 2018-12-03 12:17:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So don't covet is don't fall for the charm? The word in Arabic is "praise".

1028041601845788672 2018-08-10 17:13:12 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Hint: The way Lebanese correlates with "Arabic" at ~.7 on the PCA implies an expected upper bound of ~<50% (square) in terms of composition if one could do such an aggregation.   When school starts, some motivated student might try to replicate.
1028038196054159361 2018-08-10 16:59:40 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3rd error in reasoning.
1028037267481403392 2018-08-10 16:55:59 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Your own PCA denies what you are writing, so far. But let's wait if you complete it.  Science is hard.
1028034768447983616 2018-08-10 16:46:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Keep going, Dr "profound impact", PhD. Do you have others?  BTW Leb says "bi", not "fi", "l" not "al", rarely "7atta", "ma" was used in BBle & cd be Indo-European (see my note)...
1028033824343695361 2018-08-10 16:42:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Ghassan is surely wondering: PhD is defending an error in reasoning with a worse error in reasoning. The point is that there is evidence Latin exists, with clarity about its properties, not phantom lang.  Are there minimum analytical tests (GRE style) before that PhD?
1028032081253855232 2018-08-10 16:35:22 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> This is sophistry: they don't have to mix equally (actually no individual is an even mix, even "roughly"), so long as they mix you cannot have a tree.  Gabish? (BTW I am enjoying this; it reminds me similar reasoning errors by economists)
1028028544574783488 2018-08-10 16:21:19 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> ...and there are an almost endless bundle of ... stuff it doesn not share with your "Arabic" stuff.
1028028276118368256 2018-08-10 16:20:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> "Had Latin not been written"... but it was written. It's not a phantom language. Did you really not pick up the fallacy?
1028022297389621249 2018-08-10 15:56:30 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Ghassan, the problem I've had with these 2, Lameen and PhD is that they can't get basic trees right, nor can they read a PCA, not can they get dynamics (i.e. something w/time).  The point is not to convince linguists too invested in BS, but pple who are directly concerned.

1028001244802150401 2018-08-10 14:32:50 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> False analogy, again. Lebanese descends from Old Semitic languages, directly, & indirectly via "Arabic", etc.   Path dependence matters. The tree is BS. Total BS.
1027984023916896257 2018-08-10 13:24:24 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Voila: trees in genetic are done much better. You invert: Leb has 3-4 parents, etc. pic.twitter.com/zMe9kzdtrY

1027906223369342977 2018-08-10 08:15:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Trees in genetics are often in reverse (branching in). Unlike linguistics they are based on mixings.  Linguistic trees are BS. pic.twitter.com/gQSjZKKcRw
1027897841283473414 2018-08-10 07:41:57 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> For haplogroups, there is a crisp ascendance with mutation errors <10^-10.  For autosomal, ignore trees but there is a time dimension easy to ascertain.
1027893253432111104 2018-08-10 07:23:43 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Better than trees for linguistics. Much better. Or, to be precise, much less stupid.  But you need to deal with the constraints of the nodes as error rates compound rapidly. So there are problems in building them.

I am going after psychologists as total BS. At least philology has culture and erudition in it.   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07532.pdf …
1027877826354208768 2018-08-10 06:22:25 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You mean of the order of 10^-9? Stay out of this scientism.
1027874700096139270 2018-08-10 06:10:00 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> That's nonsense. Total nonsense.  Physics is deterministic, with waning error terms. Translating its properties for complex systems is what I've spent my life debunking (and getting $$$ from their mistakes).  Please don't compare linguistics to physics.

1027869101597908992 2018-08-10 05:47:45 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The tree is not applicable in the absence of crisp genetic descendance, & cross terms.  That's not science, but bad scholarship.
1027868117429567489 2018-08-10 05:43:50 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Something tells me (and  it  is thrilling to see Lameen and co trying PCAs) that in the application of probability: data science & machine learning, "categories" are replaced by "distances".  (Except of course if there is no noise)
1027867056035848194 2018-08-10 05:39:37 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I am back in the US, this is what I have. They use the 3 (Dlou3, n2ou3) but not 7 or 2 because pple know if it is a 7 or h, or q or 2  from context.  Spelling is all over the map. pic.twitter.com/Ok5vXTY32U
1027862875396816897 2018-08-10 05:23:00 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The Syrian nationalist Antoun S3adé had an idea of the Levant (Greater Syria) that he kept expanding until he got Mesopotamia (+ Cyprus + S. Anatolia) in it. ISIS later had exactly the same idea: Sham+Mesopotamia (& they are the reason Lebs want out of the "Arab" thingy).
1027860626817933312 2018-08-10 05:14:04 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Even funnier: the new hamzé. As in Montaigne's days, when there were are as many spelling version as there were printers. pic.twitter.com/9d0ZJZBR1K
1027859798988148737 2018-08-10 05:10:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> "We are confident that...will" is something to never, never use in science. I know that you don't mean it, but it says that you are using the data to tell your story, rather than the reverse.  Also, Lameen: Mehri is clearly something on its own.
1027858109857972224 2018-08-10 05:04:04 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5) Languages are a bottom-up thingy. Looks like the only secular party who likes to write in Arabic is the government. Everything else has mutated into "Leb" (latin characters): menus in rstrants, advertising, conversations on the web.  This pic is in a Shiite area in S. Leb. pic.twitter.com/F30rPhHpHl
1027856362200547328 2018-08-10 04:57:08 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 4) The reason I said a language is born isn't just the dictionary. There are other things I can't discuss for now. The point is that since the Syrian war, a large segment of the population "wants out" of Arab world.  Hint: A language is born when books are translated into it.
1027855772527550465 2018-08-10 04:54:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3) Your PCA (still incomplete) shd show only one clear dimension: time. Heb & vestigial lang. (Turoyo, etc.) vs modern ones coming from mixtures.  In other words, Semitic lang. too close to separate neatly.  (PS Note that the rules of grammar & other markers aren't even included)
1027854754368708609 2018-08-10 04:50:44 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 1) If you avoided family trees (for now), called these Semitic or Levantine family, works. Problem: the word "Arabic" is too political (related to a holy book)  2) The 4-6 rules for something ="Arabic" are circular/cherry picked, there are many others.

1026939048223563776 2018-08-07 16:12:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, since the other ethnicities were Syriac or Greek. And there were no physical ethnicities once one acted as Roman citizen & spoke Greek: all Meds looked the same.  Nabateans looked like Romans (Plautus). It was class (Senatorial, etc.) The Levant produced 5 Roman emperors.
1026936668086063104 2018-08-07 16:02:35 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Roman citizens took Roman names. All Phoenicians had Roman names for public reasons. Arabs: Some Nabateans  like Hareth became Aretas, etc. Philip the Arab (Hawran) was Marcus Julius Philippus son of Julius Marinus, etc.

1026909542460862464 2018-08-07 14:14:48 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The correct (evolutionary) way to see what happens is:  +Life expectancy while reaching full (socially accepted) reproductive age, i.e. ~15-25. Which will be much higher: In the previous example it would be 67. So childhood mortality removed 27 years of "average" life exp!
1026906971117690888 2018-08-07 14:04:35 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Simply, if 40% died in childbirth (or very young, which is about historical number), 50% died at 60, and 10% died at 92, the "average" life expectation would be ~40.  Childhood mortalily  hugely skews the average.

1026400707153473537 2018-08-06 04:32:52 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Many Aramaic words have broken plurals here. We discussed broken plural frequencies (low compared to dual/singl) Maybe it came from the Levant...

1026234934502088705 2018-08-05 17:34:09 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Remember they wrote in Greek after 3rd C and before that they lost a war. Tons of philosophers (earlier Thales, Zeno, etc.) A lot of architects were Phoenicians, a lot of technology, no writing *survives*. They lost wars and weren't dominant to keep their language as ling frca
1026226710440755201 2018-08-05 17:01:28 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No. Do you want to be blocked?
1026219729701273600 2018-08-05 16:33:44 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So maybe Lameen's separations s vs sh, g vs j are not convincing as real markers of languages. All js in placenames were made "g" without additional transformation. Jounié was Gounié, Jzzin was Gazzin, Bijjé was Baggé.
1026217307092201472 2018-08-05 16:24:06 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The "p"->"b" may have something to do with Eastern vs Western Armenian.

Did they come after Boulos?  --- Anyway looking at place names almost all Syriac/Phoenician. Rosh or Rish become "Ras" w/o rest into Arabic. Rosh Beirot =>Ras Bayrut not "Ras l Bi2r assaghir"
1026208089090007041 2018-08-05 15:47:29 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Indeed. But not stable for timing. Paul => Boulos but Opium =>Afioun which came later.
1026207709958467585 2018-08-05 15:45:58 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I meant can a Syriac speaker emulate an Arabic "s" to communicate, just as a French person uses the Germanic "r" without changing language? Yesu3 is good example of taking "s" in an existing pronounciation (3isa in Arabic). This is central.

1026202816141045760 2018-08-05 15:26:31 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> A lot of docs written in Phoenician were lost, but a lot of Phoenicians wrote in lingua franca later (Greek) as was the norm in Levant after 3nd Century BC, same as Indians writing in English now.  Does it make Josephus count as non Jewish?
1026201892819492871 2018-08-05 15:22:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Siqano<=> shoqano? More general, this s vs sh shift as a marker of language transmission ignores aerial influence: could say that the Ashkenazi souding Hebrew spoken by a class-consious Yemeni comes via Yiddish, no?  We say Yésu3 for Yeshu3 but it doesn't come from Arabic, no?

But nobody knows MSA as subject studies are in French, English, Armenian, (even Greek prewar) and Arabic is studied like a dead lang. Evidence: sold 4% of my books in Leb in Arabic, rest Engl, Fr.
1026101382556860416 2018-08-05 08:43:28 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So what do you call "Lebanese"? The high language or the rural one?
1026101175752552448 2018-08-05 08:42:38 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Same with colors. In Beiruti pple say "mswadd" for "darkening" (from Aswad).  Here we say "msha7war" (from sh7war). But when one speaks in public, the Beiruti Arabization is automatic.
1026100433369157632 2018-08-05 08:39:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Another word: leg and foot = si2ono (si2ano further south) here. In Beirut educated pple imitate the Arabic "rjl" with "Ijr". There is a stigma against speaking like me in public, so pple Arabize to sound sophisticated.

Kirsho for "his kirsh" Most of the use of "robb" (we use the Syriac "o", my name is pronounced Tolib) is associated with quality more often than size: "huwwé robb'l njroro" ="He is a great carpenter".

Looks like 1)  Levant and Arabia have separate populations, 2) No gene flow from Arabia to Levant, only reverse, so the stories are backward.  Much more on that later. Did Natufians invent Semitic lang.?
1025090220088324098 2018-08-02 13:45:28 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3) This is unweighted. Once you introduce weights for words, immediately effective "n" decreases and you need more data and more "dialects".  You can sort of "smell" flows on PCA if well done.  As far as Safaitic, consider the theory that Semitic lang went Levant->Arabia.
1025087987548397568 2018-08-02 13:36:36 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 2) This is a great way to organize data. But notice the complication.

1024666971856621568 2018-08-01 09:43:38 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Take the simplest example, d=2 , only 2 variables, length n. The PCA maps to simple correlation. And correlation gets more stable as n increases.
1024666367860113410 2018-08-01 09:41:14 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, Hythem. Of course n matters hugely. You are conflating dimensionality (fixed at 10) and number of observations (words). Significance grows at ~sqrt(n) [see Marchenko-Pastur]. But adding dimensions worsens in the absence of more words.

1024654743594037249 2018-08-01 08:55:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Forget distance. Take a word, "x". 1 if in language, 0 if not (or, better, -1).  You will have a lot more lines, don't worry about idles ones.
1024652489222750210 2018-08-01 08:46:05 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Lameen, you absolutely need more stuff (Swadesh is too small). The first 2 PCAs represent 55% of the total variance when binarized, meaning 2 dimensions not sufficient info.

1024553966615638016 2018-08-01 02:14:35 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Is the total variance of the 2 PCs only .6? It means it is 50% random error (since .3 from random in my Monte Carlo simulation--analytically can try Marchenko-Pastur).
1024552948918050816 2018-08-01 02:10:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Scaling is neutral, but relative weighting is not. In other words, by binarizing you remove arbitrary relative variance. You also move from n=100 ->300-400
1024452597749563396 2018-07-31 19:31:47 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 1) Just saw what Lameen did, smth I didn't realize. Needs to have {0,1} as {1,2,...5} do not indicate distance (5 is not 5 x 1). So you need take every word, put 1 if it is in the language, 0 else. Indicator function. For genes (diploid) they use 0,1,2 only (2 if in both parents)

Note your real n ~50-80 when genetics uses 62000.  It is critical for time dim to include Geez, Maghreb, etc.

A tiny bit of randomness percolates quickly across the branches of the tree.

Under high variance, you go closer to 1/n probability per team, where n is the number of teams, with minor variations (except for the very bad teams such as Saudi Barbaria).

996375277394649089 2018-05-15 08:02:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The Levantine word for "dark" (for skin, shades of color, etc.) is ghami2 is the same as "deep" (diff from Arabic), from Semitic root עָמוֹק. The werb ghammi2 = to go deep underwater or underground.   ghame2 غامق becomes عميق (3amiq) in Arabic.

995770955870941184 2018-05-13 16:01:11 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So you can see on the horizontal line the Greeks connect to the Lebanese, not Levant.

989504409041334273 2018-04-26 09:00:09 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 9) Remember that the "University" system for this "liberal education" (trivium/quadrivium) was historically closely associated with, and supervised by, the Church.  Technical education was left to free thinkers.
989496269495205888 2018-04-26 08:27:49 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 8) The idea that liberal education makes free thinkers is about the greatest myth: empirically, liberal education creates the exact opposite of "thinkers" and "free": indoctrinated and slaves. https://twitter.com/Plato4Now/status/989487426639990785 …

989490790245326849 2018-04-26 08:06:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 7) Finally, we can split education:  + Taught by nonskininthegame people (math, poetry, etc.)  + Taught by skininthegame people (engineering, medicine, belly dancing, plumbing, finance, law, burglarizing, computer "science", accounting, ...)  In SEPARATE institutions.
989486008839426048 2018-04-26 07:47:02 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 6) The educational model is now imploding as the only thing people seem to learn at colleges is ideology by losers who became professors because they aren't good enough to create things & got together to BS in a citation ring  #RentSeekers (not just in economics, but everywhere)
989484862825549825 2018-04-26 07:42:29 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5b) The French solved the problem with knowledge exams for educators ("aggregation"); you never end up having people judged solely by peers (See #SkininTheGame ).  (Same problems: "know economics" is interpreted as knowing theories by economists, not economic facts).
989484125571645440 2018-04-26 07:39:33 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5a) The problem of the peer review system is selecting professors on theories abt subject never checked for basic knowledge of subject. It is common for people to know the "post colonial gender theory" of Levant, teach it, but never the actual facts.
989483556769550336 2018-04-26 07:37:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 4) So we need to separate "things to learn to be civilized" and "things you learn to do things" with separate institutions.  The only overlap I could find was mathematics, though not a strong argument since applied math is a v. different animal.
989482522881986560 2018-04-26 07:33:11 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3) The Anglo-Saxon world conflated the two, with aristocrat-envy:   + Education to be civilized. (Literature, philosophy, poetry, abstract math, history, stamp collecting, etc.)  + Education to learn to do things. (Engineering, medicine, accounting, law, belly dancing, plumbing)
989481839315374080 2018-04-26 07:30:28 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 2) For instance, mathematics as taught for "liberal" education, was theoretical mind exercise. Euclid's theorem was never used in building.  Meanwhile builders (parts of guilds with trade secrets) were using their own heuristic, richer, geometry. (see #Antifragile)

Distilling the conversation with @bryan_caplan hosted by @tylercowen  1) There has been a traditional separation between:     + "liberal education" for free men, (liber), who didn't work for a living, &       +"technical education", for those who labor.

When the downside is bigger you go for minimum variance.  Why explains why winning teams mark time and losing teams take risks.

957712404707758080 2018-01-28 14:30:05 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I read your paper. The problem comes from the transformation PRIOR to PCAs. Indeed, a problem, but one that does not exist here.
957711720872628225 2018-01-28 14:27:22 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Not the same problem, Stephen. This is very robust. The PCAs are unique since L-2 and data is 55K points. Ordinal/Rand stats preserve when you change norms such as differential entropy (my favorite)
957711114107850753 2018-01-28 14:24:57 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> For the other one, yes, but not until Zalloua's paper is published.

957635607618097152 2018-01-28 09:24:55 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Exactly the problem. 1) Actors are trained to NOT seem stupid. 2) They carry more credibility than other unqualified something.

957601111602618368 2018-01-28 07:07:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You are very confused. "Intellectual" doesn't mean famous, just someone who engages in some classes of activities. Actor is someone who acts, not necessarily successfully.
957600469198737409 2018-01-28 07:05:17 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Actually, I've lived in NY for 35y and never met an actor. Not once.

957598575344738305 2018-01-28 06:57:46 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> To understand why what happens in Hollywood is irrelevant to the rest of humans:  1) How many ACTORs do you have among your friends?  2) How many ACTOR friends do your friends have?  Actors rarely mix with real people.

949268571036815360 2018-01-05 07:17:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Geneticists never categorize you as "X" based on haplogroups or markers, only use distance across a minimum of 2 independent benchmarks.

As you intuited, one can only assert categorization/distance via independent variables. I reexplained in my article. This Putten doesn't even realize he is BS vending.
949257427932909569 2018-01-05 06:33:01 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> We need you back!
949257210894454785 2018-01-05 06:32:10 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Lameen's main error is treating autosomal DNA as haplogroups (rules that come down whole). You NEVER compare 2 individuals from haplogroups/haplotypes but from autosomal.

949250540873150464 2018-01-05 06:05:39 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Strange: they need n-> \infty for that when I just took \Delta t ->0.
949248561971105792 2018-01-05 05:57:48 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> At least in genetics we know how we *should*  measure distance between A and B.
949245391425466368 2018-01-05 05:45:12 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> You can reframe the problem as a stopping time one. When do you stop? A bit more complicated.
949244851782148097 2018-01-05 05:43:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> At the level of vocabulary, if you are comparing 2alb, to lb and qlb, because they depend on one another, you construct PCA1 PCA2 (if 95%) and compare the 3 to these, then get 2D linguistic distance on map.
949243978058264576 2018-01-05 05:39:35 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> This is what I have been telling Lameen for a while. Meanwhile this allowed me to read enough linguistics to realize that the problem is even worse but can be rectified.
949242606185340929 2018-01-05 05:34:08 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> This is exactly what science means. In genetics has the stamp of science because they use PCAs that are "meaningless to 99.999...% of people" because that's the right thing to do.
949241378999033856 2018-01-05 05:29:15 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So 1/e doesn't come from Poisson but from memorylessness.
949240694153019392 2018-01-05 05:26:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> This is the right question:colinearity is the problem. If if x comes from y and y comes somewhat from z and x comes somewhat from z, you have a problem. They need to be made ORTHOGONAL, by PCAs. You can only compare independent variables that way.
949239586642972672 2018-01-05 05:22:08 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No, what can be a problem is 1) "rules on the fly" and not others, 2) generalizations from the grammatical shift to other traits. It is better to use other terms to describe "decendence" when it is not so clean.
949238244104916992 2018-01-05 05:16:48 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Which is why since I have been doing DNA analyses, I feel linguistics genetics are patched up, imitations of something that should not be used that way.
949237957273276416 2018-01-05 05:15:39 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Bingo. If a classification is certain (Italian is Latin, Leb is Semitic) it is one thing. If a classification is not certain, don't use it as it passes for certain. It is not science.
949237509640413184 2018-01-05 05:13:52 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> It is exactly the point: because it is memoriless, probability is independent of time.
949229739654500353 2018-01-05 04:43:00 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> This continuum idea is highly ad hoc: if makes for weak not strong categorization.

948740704490180608 2018-01-03 20:19:45 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 8) PS- Moral of the story: if you even invoke the "Dunning Kruger effect" against someone as a way to degrade his knowledge of the subject matter, expect yours to be degraded.
948739933568749569 2018-01-03 20:16:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> For those following the "scientifically rigorous" bloviations of Mr van Putten, here is a thread. https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/948684416376852480 …
948738578669948928 2018-01-03 20:11:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 7) This is it for now as Mr Marijn van Putten  @phoenixnl no doubt needs to be establish accordance w/"scientific standards" first, his points later in accordance with rules of evidence.  In other words, no BS vending. If he can.  Good night, לילה טוב
948737845828706304 2018-01-03 20:08:23 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 6) Finally, as one can see Semitic linguistics is plagued with elementary rigor. Establishing intelligibility betw. Leb and Arabic doesn't flow from ad nauseam repetition, but something called EVIDENCE. And distinguising languages on the bases of 2-5 rules is called "fitting"
948737388146253829 2018-01-03 20:06:34 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5) So main argument Leb comes from some abstract unseen "proto-Arabic" is the commonality of a negation "ma" which appears to be Indo-European (Anatolian?).

948697202528047109 2018-01-03 17:26:53 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The point is that 1) is such a definition of dialect in use? 2) is it narrow jargon? 3) it is BS vending?

948687432173617152 2018-01-03 16:48:04 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> What I mean is that in the linguistics jargon can a dead language (Ancient Greek, Latin) from which a modern language descends (Modern Greek, Italian) be a "dialect" OF  that language? Can someone say that Ancient Greek is a DIALECT OF Modern Greek?
948684416376852480 2018-01-03 16:36:05 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Is there a linguist in the room who can assert that Ancient Greek can be called a dialect of Modern Greek? Thanks in advance.  Can explain why.

I fully accept all your points.

Will reply later but for now: North Lebanon (my language) has the Canaanite shift, not the rest. But the rest doesn’t vary. How is it indivisible? Thanks.

947451235220840448 2017-12-31 06:55:51 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Yes, rulers converted to the religion of the province (Shehab for instance), but almost never INTO Druze (exception is Janbulad who is still not fully accepted). In Byblos/jerd/Kesrwan most conversions were Zoroastrian=>Shiite <=> Maronite.

947431919746273280 2017-12-31 05:39:06 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 3) This is an application of the minority rule: a small minority gives the accent.
947431559493292032 2017-12-31 05:37:40 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> No. the ח, ֵע, and many others (uncluding the 3ayin w/dot=>Ghayn) vanished. HEbrew is spoken with a Yiddish accent. What Sephardis gave is the stress on last vowel.

932663398239752193 2017-11-20 11:34:16 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> That's the problem with Big Government, not one with taxation.  Gabish?
932662396648292355 2017-11-20 11:30:18 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Your point is logically inconsistent with higher taxation. If Walmart drivers drive more, they pay more gas tax as these maintain the road. Install more tolls on roads . Very sloppy reasoning all acorss.
932639344514433025 2017-11-20 09:58:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 8) When you disguize CLASS ENVY as an intellectual argument (as Piketty, Krugman, IYIs), it always, always shows.
932634684303069184 2017-11-20 09:40:10 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 7) So we accept tht taxes are collective coersion; we can make it rational by allowing groups to form their own communities w/their own collective rules, as in CHF. This is why the ONLY political orientation I have is LOCALISM.
932633239952478208 2017-11-20 09:34:26 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 6) I only reply to comments that are wrong, not those that are sufficiently stupid to be "not even wrong".
932625610928779265 2017-11-20 09:04:07 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Indeed.

932620531458871296 2017-11-20 08:43:56 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I've argued that this can only work if, by symmetry,  you also allow the rich an equally proportional part of public spaces.

932618622547169280 2017-11-20 08:36:21 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 5) In that sense taxation can be seen as a Punishment ( جزية)  on the wealthy for them to be allowed to stay wealthy. Which is OK, but don't be fooled.
932617682591117312 2017-11-20 08:32:37 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 4) Islamic law gives insights: taxes are separated as 1) Charity ( زكاة, alms) vs. 2) Punishment ( جزية) (on Dhimmis (like me) to be allowed to stay Christian+ خراج). Charity (~2-3%) goes to the poor, Punishment to state coffers/military. Charity implies *thanking* benefactor.
932611781486436352 2017-11-20 08:09:10 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Accept disproportionate taxation, but be no fool: it is the coercive result of 1man-1vote just as in past it was military force. in LCD, it is patronage. In past, taxation was disguized as "Protection" & small, w/~5-15%. Then became "services". Now "fairness".
932607290380779520 2017-11-20 07:51:19 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> He is saying the way you nitpicked his syntax is pathetic (fewer vs less) ; it is.  I can tell an imbecile and you are one.
932606503902642176 2017-11-20 07:48:12 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> 1) Adjust for negative taxes, 2) expand taxpayer base to include ALL.
932600639992971264 2017-11-20 07:24:54 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The reason we have "progressive" taxation is the 1 person-1 vote, with the spin that zero-sum, which applies only to IYI jobs. https://medium.com/incerto/inequality-and-skin-in-the-game-d8f00bc0cb46 …

895442142683840513 2017-08-09 19:30:17 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> What SJW don't get is the implied racism of "white" & "colored": if you mix white & colored you get colored.  That implies purity not race.
895432657529704448 2017-08-09 18:52:36 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Same with Assyrians. They were not "Semites", but like Phoenicians DNA close to Iranians/Anatolians. So could be Babylonian moving West.
895432375089418240 2017-08-09 18:51:29 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> The big mystery is why Phoenicians were closer to Indo Europeans w/ a Semitic language? Probably invaded. Languages have minority rules.
895432097506000896 2017-08-09 18:50:23 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> A lot of this Greenberg nonsense. Languages have random mutations at a rate of 10^7 times that of genes. And cross-fert is not there.

895429468239663104 2017-08-09 18:39:56 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I found linguists behind the curve once I started doing genetics. Genes are clear abt descendance. Never languages. And they mutate fast.

895428147159506944 2017-08-09 18:34:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Exactly what I am saying. But if French and Italian have 1 common ancestor we don't say French is derived from Italian.
895427831710105601 2017-08-09 18:33:25 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Never made that claim. Claimed that derived of older sources than Arabic, things we have in common.  Look at my chart.

895417576704102400 2017-08-09 17:52:40 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> But are they of Arabic origin? Or do they make it there. Now let me ask you about this expanded Swadesh   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50282823/semitic-3.pdf …
895399651507130369 2017-08-09 16:41:27 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Thanks Jason. The 90% is words used in ordinary life, expanded Swadesh.

895372392834490369 2017-08-09 14:53:08 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Mr Sharro, you are indeed ...  The format is from books in Semitic linguistics. You perhaps should go advise them.
895368941488525312 2017-08-09 14:39:25 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Are you an "expert" in anything to call pple "amateurish"? Did you ever publish to professionals?
895368637183401984 2017-08-09 14:38:12 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> For if you go into more complicated terms Turkish Iranian and Urdu become predom Arabic when they are not.
895367160071106560 2017-08-09 14:32:20 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Mr Sharro the structure of Semitic languages is 3 cons. I offer that you delete your tweets and nothing hapnd. OK
895363725582102528 2017-08-09 14:18:41 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Mr Sharro, keep going. BTW standaed is 100 words. After that we can compare to use of Ar in Turkish.
895360166744469504 2017-08-09 14:04:33 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> They are used 90% of the time. Stay with your first statement and find the embrssng mistakes. I can teach you statistics later.
895359034659876865 2017-08-09 14:00:03 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> How many olive trees away from the Med coast?
895358797333630976 2017-08-09 13:59:06 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Also Mr Sharro had you published any scholarly work, you wdv realizd that nitpickers are of invaluable help in improving the final product
895358340154499072 2017-08-09 13:57:17 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> I am very direct.  I asked the doctor; he said can't do anything about it. So you need to live with it.
895357395135868928 2017-08-09 13:53:32 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> Explain which mistakes (if you can) instead of throwing words. They can be corrected what matters is the statistical total. Tangible

895352327263182848 2017-08-09 13:33:24 Central Standard Time <nntaleb> So Mr Sharro if you have a question about my statements, you can ask me directly. As you can see I always answer.
