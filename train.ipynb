The conversation is not for a professional investor to listen to, but for anyone wondering what the difference is between a CFO and a VP on Wall Street. The episode was recorded at the CFO's residence (in order to not make it appear there is a big party).\n",

            "\n",
            "One of the reasons why the CEO is a bit more concerned with making good returns is because the compensation is not high enough to make you feel better.\n",
